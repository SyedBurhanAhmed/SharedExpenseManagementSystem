# Shared Expenses Management System (SEMS)

## Description

The Shared Expenses Management System (SEMS) is a C++ application designed to help users manage and track shared expenses among multiple members. This project was developed during my first semester as part of the Programming Fundamentals course. The system allows users to add members, record expenses, calculate balances, and save expense history in a text file.

## Features

- **Add Members**: Input and store names of members participating in shared expenses.
- **Show Members**: Display a list of all members.
- **Add Expense**: Record an expense, specify the payer, and automatically calculate the share of each member.
- **Calculate Net Balance**: Maintain a record of what each member owes or is owed.
- **Save Expense History**: Store the detailed expense history in a text file for future reference.
- **Show Expense History**: Read and display the saved expense history from the text file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your C++ IDE (such as Code::Blocks).
3. Build and run the program.

## Usage

- Run the program and follow the prompts to manage shared expenses.
- Choose options from the menu to add members, add expenses, and view history.

## Files

- **main.cpp**: The main source file containing the implementation of the SEMS.
- **expense_history.txt**: (This will be created automatically when you save the expense history.)

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project by adding features or improving the code.
